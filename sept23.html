<aside class="notes"><p>Imagine.... it was cool out... you descend into these caves. by the guttering lamp light, the images dance and flicker and seem to come alive. What might these images mean? What do the dots convey? What is <em>the message?</em></p>
<p>per the guardian: &#39;Cave paintings of species such as reindeer, fish and now extinct cattle called aurochs and bison have been found across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>. Alongside these images, sequences of dots and other marks have been found in more than 600 ice age images on cave walls and portable objects across Europe....By using the birth cycles of equivalent animals today as a reference point, the team deduced that the number of marks associated with ice age animals were a record, by lunar month, of when they were mating. They believe the inclusion of a “Y” sign, formed by adding a diverging line to another, meant “giving birth”.</p>

The Medium is the Message
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>sometimes the fact of the medium is often more important than the message itself. the way we extend our minds into new technologies has an impact on how we use old technologies; he called this &#39;amputation&#39;- we extend our minds, our abilities with cars, we tie off or allow to wither the way we used to build cities with walking in mind. consequently, our health suffers, and we end up with cities where we couldn&#39;t really walk even if we wanted to. Such is barrhaven. He also argues that when we over extend, when the negative effects of the new technology become too much, we lose the benefits of the new technology.</p>
<p>Medium implies: something being carried: but what?</p>
<p>And media come in different <em>classes</em> or kinds of things</p>
<p>Who decides that something is <em>important</em> ? </p>
<p>Whoever makes that decision gains importance/power themselves!</p>
<p>Classification and the catalogue as a control of knowledge dissemination (Foucault). he argues that when classifications shift, there&#39;s been a shift in power or focus too. he also points out that classification puts some things out-of-bound, all the better to control them.  He explores how these classifications get made manifest in architecture, for instance, and how they create new objects for study.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>Boole, Englishman; mid 19th century: writes laws of thought 1854 that used set theory to work out that logical statements could be written as a kind of algebraic equation</p>
<p>Shannon: American: mid 20th century: MA THESIS shows that boolean logic could be represented via electromagnetic relay switches.  Also showed that the &#39;entropy&#39; of a message could be described mathematically independent of its semantics; he called this its &#39;information&#39; and worked out how to measure it (basically, it&#39;s a function of all possible combination of elements. cn u rd ths thn u gt th mssg!</p>
<p>&#39;Information&#39; is a measurment of that redundancy, or how &#39;surprising&#39; the next letter/sound/wave/ is. </p>
<p>Shannon Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty associated with a random variable. It is used to measure the average amount of information that is needed to identify the value of a random variable. The higher the entropy, the greater the amount of uncertainty or unpredictability. In other words, Shannon Entropy measures the amount of information that is needed to accurately predict the value of a random variable, ie, the next letter in a sentence.</p>
<p>The concept of a bit was introduced at the same time by Shannon and is fundamental to understanding entropy. A bit is a unit of information that has two possible states: 0 or 1. These two states represent the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system. </p>
<p>For example, if a system has two possible outcomes, such as heads or tails in a coin toss, then the system has one bit of information. The more possible outcomes, the more bits of information, and thus the higher the entropy. Entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory and is used to measure the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>just like everything else in the 19th century, things in mathematics are hotting up. there is a movement to put all of mathematics onto a rational, systematic basis by developing axioms that could be the building blocks of a &#39;total&#39; mathematics. In 1931 Kurt Godel demonstrates that you can&#39;t build a proof around the consistency of a mathematical system that describes all of mathematics. To solve this issue, to work out which things can be computed or can&#39;t, Turing devises a system capable of computing everything that can be computed.</p>
<p>Combine that with Boole &amp; Shannon, and you have the framework for a modern digital computer</p>

Not, 'Can machines think?' but rather, 'Can a machine do something that looks like thinking?'

Man A | Woman B in a room, respond to written questions. Person C in other room has to decide which message came from the woman.
